# Spellslinger

Welcome to Spellslinger! This mod is designed to reshape various
aspects of Baldur's Gate 3 to align with the preferences of both me
and my friends. While I've incorporated elements from other mods,
I've also blended in my own unique twists for a well-integrated
gameplay experience.

## Status
**In Development:** The mod is still being worked on and isn't ready
for gameplay yet.

## Disclaimer
This is my first time modding, and many parts of this mod draw from
the work of others. Because of this, I might make the repository
private later on.

## Changes
For a detailed list of our changes and the reasoning behind them, check out the [CHANGES](Docs/CHANGES.md) file.

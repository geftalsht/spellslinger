### Added

- Changelog.
- `CHANGES.md` file that compiles all implemented changes in an easy to
read format.
- A workaround to force story recompilation (credits to Norbyte) in
the mod proper, aimed at streamlining development and simultaneous
vanilla play.
- Balance adjustments to the *Acid Splash*, *Blade Ward*,
*Chill Touch*, *Dancing Lights*, *Eldritch Blast*, *Fire Bolt*,
and *Guidance* cantrips.

### Removed

- All undocumented spell changes. These will be rethought and
potentially reintroduced in future versions with proper
documentation.

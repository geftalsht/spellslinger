## Changes to spells

The primary objective behind these changes is to enhance game enjoyment.
It's important to note that these alterations don't strictly adhere to the
original 5e rules. In fact, some spells may evolve to be distinctly different
from their 5e counterparts as envisaged by Wizards of the Coast.
